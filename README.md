# Mentorbot 3.0

A custom Discord app by the Rivals of Aether Academy, written with [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py).

See Mentorbot in the [Rivals Academy](https://discord.me/mentor), the [Official Rivals of Aether Discord](https://discord.gg/roa), or [add it to your own server](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=475596740368793600&permissions=18432&scope=bot).

## Universal Features

### Hitbox Commands

Mentorbot's hitbox commands provide detailed frame data and hitbox images for any move in the game, covering the movesets of all 14 characters.

### Server Moderation

#### Action Logging

Track edited and deleted messages, members joining and leaving, and other server actions via Mentorbot's action logging functionality. Enable this feature by creating a channel called <kbd>#action-log</kbd> and ensuring Mentorbot has permissions to send messages.

#### Commands

<kbd>!whois [member]</kbd> provides detailed information on a given member specified by username, @mention, or user ID. This command is only accessible to those with permissions to ban users.

<kbd>!clear [n]</kbd> deletes the specified amount of messages from the current chat, and logs this into <kbd>#action-log</kbd>. This command is only accessible to those with permissions to manage messages. To enable this functionality, Mentorbot needs the required permissions to delete messages, and so needs to be invited via [this link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=475596740368793600&permissions=268757056&scope=bot).

### Role Management

Major role management is handled by Mentorbot's role reaction system in the <kbd>#set-your-roles</kbd> channel. Members set their main and secondary characters, region, and more by adding and removing message reactions.
